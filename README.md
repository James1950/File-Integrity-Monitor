<h1>File-Integrity-Monitor</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<b>I created a File Integrity Monitor or (FIM) that looks at files in a directory and lets the user know if any modifications to the directory are made.
The code uses a baseline to see whether changes to the directory have been made.
You can collect a new baseline for your directory and be notified whenever a change occurs.

<h2>Flow Chart</h2>



<h2>How it works</h2>
<b>When run, a user enters either A or B to either create a new baseline (photograph of their directory to compare changes to) or start searching for changes.</b>
